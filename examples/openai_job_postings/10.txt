About the Team

The Supercomputing team owns the entire process of building OpenAI’s compute and infrastructure, which includes the deployment of huge clusters using Kubernetes and Azure, and building the internal experiment platform for running/training the world’s largest AI models.

We work at the very cutting edge of speed and scale, combining the traditions of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in a modern cloud and containerized environment.

 

About the Role

As an engineering manager in the Scalability Pillar, you will lead a team to simplify and scale the operations of our DC-scale computers. You will use widely available tools effectively, while building novel solutions when we scale beyond their limits, expanding our ability to handle novel hardware, rapidly growing numbers of (ever larger) clusters, and a fast-growing set of research users.

You do not need to be an ML/DL expert to deliver world-class infrastructure, but you do need to be able to quickly obtain a deep technical understanding of new domains.

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:

Directly managing ICs responsible for building the scalability pillar of our Supercomputing organization

Build and grow high performing teams in a deeply iterative, collaborative, fast-paced environment to bring our technology to millions of users around the world, and ensure it’s delivered with safety and reliability in mind.

Design and operate the orchestration and monitoring stack for our supercomputers

Automate everything until we have unprecedented control of our stack

Deeply understand what it means for a supercomputer to be healthy and useful to researchers and enable frontier model training

 

You might thrive in this role if you:

Are a seasoned technical leader, excited to do hand-on technical work but equally excited to lead technical teams to peak performance.

Deeply understand k8s and other cluster orchestration systems

Have an execution focused mentality paired with a rigorous focus on user requirements

Can create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture that makes all feel welcome while enabling radical candor and the challenging of group think.

Have a humble attitude, an eagerness to help your colleagues, and a desire to do whatever it takes to make the team succeed.

Are experienced in collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure that reliability and scalability are considered in the design and development of new features and services.

Own problems end-to-end, and are willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done.

Have excellent communication skills. Expressing ideas clearly and listening carefully are among the most important requirements for success in this role.

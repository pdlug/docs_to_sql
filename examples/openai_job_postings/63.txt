About the Team

The Platform Systems team operates at the intersection of cutting-edge AI and distributed systems. We do the engineering and research required to train our flagship models on our largest custom built supercomputers.

We build our own model training software, and focus on the lower layers of the stack including collective communication, scheduling, compute efficiency, parallelism strategies, fault tolerance, and observability.

The models we train are key ingredients to the AI research progress at OpenAI and the field as a whole, and we continually incorporate learnings from our entire research org into our training platform.

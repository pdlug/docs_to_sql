About the team

The Trustworthy AI team works on action relevant or decision relevant research to ensure we shape A(G)I keeping societal impacts in mind and works on interventions to increase readiness. This includes work on full stack policy problems such as AI provenance, anthropomorphism of AI. We aim to translate nebulous policy problems to be technically tractable and measurable. We then use this work to inform and build interventions that increase societal readiness for increasingly intelligent systems. Our team also works on external assurances for AI (Eg. external red teaming, 3rd party verification) with an aim for increasing independent checks and forming additional layers of validation.

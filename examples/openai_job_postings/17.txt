About the Team
Our mission at OpenAI is to discover and enact the path to safe, beneficial AGI. To do this, we believe that many technical breakthroughs are needed in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, large-scale optimization, active learning, among other topics.

The Research Platform team builds robust and scalable software to support our research efforts. It also offers core development services for mission-critical goals and applications. In the Kernel Libraries team, we write compute and communication kernels for the GPUs and CPUs powering our research clusters. We also collaborate closely with the Triton compiler team to design new language features and improve the performance of generated code.

About the Role
As a Research Engineer for Kernel Libraries, you will write high-performance kernels for the training and inference workloads. You will work with other engineers across the platform team to accelerate our biggest training runs. You will also work backward from the capabilities of the GPUs to make model architectures amenable to efficient training and inference. If you are excited about maximizing HBM and NVLink bandwidth, optimizing for instruction issue rate, shuffling within a warp, managing the precious register space, and keeping the tensor cores at high utilization, this is the perfect opportunity!

This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:
Develop high-performance GPU/CPU kernels and make trade-offs that maximize end-to-end hardware utilization

Utilize knowledge of hardware features and performance characteristics to make aggressive optimizations

Work with our other platform teams to deploy your kernels, manage our training uptime, and find opportunities for optimization

Develop low-precision algorithms that deliver high performance with little loss of ML accuracy

Work with ML engineers to develop model architectures that are amenable to efficient training and inference

Work with hardware vendors and advise on HW/SW co-design

You might thrive in this role if you:
Are a strong coder with excellent skills in C/C++ and Python

Have a deep understanding of GPU, CPU, or other AI accelerator architectures

Have experience writing and optimizing compute kernels with CUDA or similar languages

Are familiar with LLM architectures and training infrastructure

Have experience driving ML accuracy with low-precision formats

Have 3+ years of relevant industry experience

Get a great deal of satisfaction with every percentage point in performance improvement

These attributes are nice to have:
PhD in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing, Compilers, or other Systems

Participation in competitive programming competitions

Experience building compilers

Experience working with hardware developers
